# 🎨 Math-Collections  
**Artistic & Mathematical Visualizations with Python**  

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains **`artistics-math.ipynb`**, a curated set of Python-based visual experiments that merge **mathematics** and **art**.  
Using advanced plotting techniques, the notebook showcases 2D and 3D renderings of mathematical patterns, curves, and surfaces.  

Whether you're an educator, a math enthusiast, or a digital artist, **Math-Collections** offers a visual playground for exploring the beauty of mathematics.

## ✨ Features  
- **Mathematical Patterns & Shapes** — Circles, polygons, and parametric curves.  
- **3D Surfaces & Wireframes** — Interactive and static plots with `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`.  
- **Colorful Artistic Plots** — Enhanced with colormaps and style customizations.  
- **Fully Reproducible** — Every figure is generated directly from the included notebook.
