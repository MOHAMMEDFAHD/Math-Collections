📐 Math-Collections

A curated collection of artistic and mathematical visualizations in Python

Overview

Math-Collections is a set of Python-based visualizations exploring the intersection of mathematics and art. This repository is designed for math enthusiasts, educators, and data artists who want to explore creative representations of mathematical concepts.

The collection is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates how geometry, trigonometry, and mathematical patterns can be brought to life using Python's plotting capabilities.
